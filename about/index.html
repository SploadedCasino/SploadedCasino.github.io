            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Sploaded Casino! I'm <strong>SploadedBoi</strong>, the developer behind this site. With a love for gaming and coding during school, I created this fun casino website.</p>
            <p>The story of creating this website started with me in freshman year bored out of my mind. I would complete my assignments early and had nothing to do, so when one of my friends brought cards to school to play blackjack (with no money), I got an idea. I got hooked to the game and wanted to play blackjack online with fake money, but there were no websites that were unblocked. So, I decided to use my boredom as a drive to create a fun blackjack website. Soon, I finished the webpage but got bored again, so my brother suggested that I add Plinko. I then realized that I should make a casino website.</p>
            <p>My goal is to continue adding more games to my casino and make it more fun to play!</p>
