            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to Sploaded Casino! I'm <strong>SploadedBoi</strong>, the developer behind this site.
                With a love for gaming and coding during school, I created this fun casino website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story of creating this website started with me in freshman year bored out of my mind. I would complete my assignments early and had nothing to do, so when one of my friends brought cards to school to play blackjack (with no money,) I got an idea. I got hooked to the game I wanted to play blackjack online with fake money, but there were no websites that were unblocked. So I decided to use my boredem as a drive to create a fun blackjack website. But, soon I finished the webpage and got bored again, so my brother suggested that I add plinko. I then realised that I sould make a casino website.</deci>
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to continue adding more games to my casino and making it more fun to play!
            </p>
